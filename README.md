## Overview

With the growing adoption of cryptocurrencies, wallet security and user privacy have become paramount. ZKSafe introduces a zero-knowledge proof based authentication system that allows users to prove ownership or authorization without revealing sensitive information, minimizing attack surfaces and improving trust.

This project is aimed at researchers, developers, and enthusiasts in the blockchain and cryptography domains seeking to explore and build upon secure wallet authentication mechanisms.

## Features

- Zero-Knowledge Proof Authentication: Users can authenticate without exposing private keys or secrets.
- Modular Architecture: Easily integrates with different wallet platforms.
- Hybrid Cryptographic Model: Combines zk-SNARK technology with traditional encryption.
- Developer-Friendly API: Well-documented interfaces for seamless integration.
- Dual Licensing: Free for academic and research use with commercial restrictions.

## Architecture

ZKSafe is composed of the following key components:
- Proof Generator: Generates zero-knowledge proofs off-chain.
- Verifier Smart Contract: On-chain contract that verifies proofs without exposing secrets.
- Client SDK: Simplifies interaction with proof generation and verification.
- Security Modules: Implements additional cryptographic primitives to enhance robustness.
